## Describe the public acceptance of the technology.
This relies particularly upon the social setting where it is applied, yet overall different advances have been related with social contentions. In the scholarly setting, there has been expanding interest and thoughtfulness regarding the public acknowledgment of innovations, as it is essential for the direction of the development of human progress. Truth be told, the person's longing for information has driven humankind to investigate the advances of science and apply them to human requirements and requests. Innovation has been characterized as an interaction, development, or mechanical strategy. Although sequentially evolving technologies are not isolated from the society in which they are inserted, they are part of the social environment. We can say that a new technology can bring about radical changes in society, while, on the other hand, the fate of that technology depends on the society in which it is applied. So, we can say that society's negative reaction to innovation might be because of the way that, albeit numerous advancements carry advantages to society, they can likewise present new dangers [1].


## Describe the impact of social networks on information and communication tech (ICT) .


## Identify skills for the use of ICT in work and life.

The progressions and advantages achieved by the joining of ICTs into human regular routine, it is likewise addressed whether the utilization of ICTs can be positive or negative. Among the fundamental abilities that are vital for the utilization of data advances in the field of life and work are [4][5]: 

* Technology management and development: This ability covers the capacities and information important to name, take care of issues, work and use ICT in any assignment. Just as taking care of and understanding ICT ideas used to name the parts and elements of PCs and organizations. it considers the capacity to utilize ICT securely, to tackle fundamental specialized issues and to oversee data and documents. Last but not least, mastering software, hardware and programs widely used in and programs widely used in society. 

* Effective communication and collaboration: Social abilities like the capacity to send and trade data and thoughts with others, just as to associate and contribute inside a gathering or local area is crucial. This is a critical skill in the process, in light of the fact that it requests insightful work all alone, including handling, changing, and designing data and thinking about the most fitting method for introducing a plan to a specific crowd. This adds the capacity to arrange arrangements inside shared regard for one another's thoughts and to foster substance with peers a way off, utilizing diverse advanced media. 

* Management and collection of information: It portrays the abilities to look, select, assess, and arrange data in computerized conditions and change or adjust the data into another item, information or foster groundbreaking thoughts. Either as a source, i.e., realizing how to find and sort data in a successful and effective way. And the other as an item, that is, changing and creating computerized data in different ways to more readily get it, convey it all the more viably to other people and foster understandings. 

* Digital coexistence: This expertise alludes to general moral preparing through directions identified with explicit conjunction difficulties presented by advanced advances in a data society. As well as exploiting the coordination and connecting openings presented by friendly or computerized networks. Without failing to remember the reality to shield themselves from hazardous circumstances on the Web remembering unseemly, computerized content or administrations for the Web or other advanced media, for example, cell phones, but likewise direct admittance to obscure individuals through these media. 

## Describe the existing regulation in Employment, Ethics, politics and the data science related regulation.

* Data science and machine learning process should be augmented as much as possible with human interference by designing systems which include human in the loop review. Moreover, especially for the risk assessment tools, one of the critical challenges of the statistical decision-making tools is the phenomenon of automation bias, where the information presented by a machine is viewed as inherently trustworthy and above skepticism. This can lead humans to over-rely on the accuracy or correctness of automated systems. In the end, Subject Matter Experts should be able to validate the results and the process. They should also be sufficiently educated in order to understand the underlying assumptions that accompanied the development of the algorithms [6]. 

* Bias in statistical models must be measured and mitigated as far as tolerance for variance in the estimates allows. One crucial factor that should be considered when training algorithms in risk assessment tools is what is known as the problem of omitted variable bias. Omitted variable bias occurs whenever a model is trained from data that does not include all of the relevant causal factors [6]. 

* Tools must not conflate multiple distinct predictions. For different risks, different scores should be measured as opposed to a single risk reflecting the risk of various outcomes [6]. 

+ Model reproducibility. Making a machine learning model reproducible requires the process of abstracting its constituent components, namely data, configuration/environment and computational graph. If all these three points are abstracted, it is possible to have a basis for model reproducibility. It is often essential to decide what the level of abstraction will be, as it is possible to focus on building very complex layers to abstract multiple machine learning libraries with specific data input/output formats [7]. 

* Trust by privacy. Privacy made at the right levels. One fundamental way to establish trust with users and relevant stakeholders is by showing that the proper process and technologies are in place to protect personal data. Technologists should make explicit effort to understand the potential implications of metadata involved and whether the metadata can expose unexpected personal information from relevant users or stakeholders [7]. 

 


## Describe security strategies and their regulation.


## Identify the regulatory framework and institutions that affect the digital economy.


# Questions & Anwers


## 1. What is a data management professional? (Jeorval)

 Is the person in charge of working with the data from the technical management of the data throughout its lifecycle to ensuring that the data is properly used and exploited. 

## 2. Do you consider that you as a data engineer could fulfill the data management profile and why? (Jeorval)

According to the definition that the book provides as well as its different ones, it is undoubtedly a position for a data engineer. Maybe with a few differences, but not big. 

## 3. Is data the raw material of information as information is? (Jeorval)

data in context. 


## 4. Do you consider data governance to be a subset of data management or vice versa and why? (Jeorval)

Data governance is a subset of data management. This is because data governance is more focused on documentation with the respective policies and procedures. Data management, on the other hand, is focused on both the documentation and the realization of data for decision making. 

## 5. Of the various data management challenges you may face, which do you consider to be the most complicated and why? (Jeorval)

Undoubtedly each of the challenges has its difficulties, but the challenge that surrounds the other challenges is "data differs from other assets" because without data there can be no other challenges you may face in data management. 

## 6. What should a data management strategy be based on and why? (Jeorval)

In business plans to use information for competitive advantage and support the company's objectives. 

## 7. What are the deliverables for a strategic plan for data management? (Jeorval)

A Data Management Charter, a data management scope statement and a data management Implementation Roadmap 

## 8. As a data engineering student, do you think there should be a data ethics course? (Jeorval)

Definitely, because sometimes a bad handling of data can bring unfavorable consequences both to us and to the company where we are working.
