## Describe trends in AI uses: as mainstream in efficiency and productivity gains.
Thanks to the use of "AI" productivity and efficiency can be seen more in companies than in everyday life, for example in today's world we have the popular virtual assistants like Alexa, Google Assistant and Siri that can help us to do activities in less time or in parallel; however, the benefits of these smart devices do not compare with what companies can get thanks to AI [1]. 

Companies can obtain the following benefits that help employees and companies in general to be more productive and efficient [1][2]: 

* Generation of ideas and strategies: Data is probably one of the best resource of organizations today; be that as it may, you must have the assets to change it, a task to which computer-based intelligence and explicitly AI straightforwardly adds to empower you to adjust when advertise conduct changes. 

* Manual process automation: AI serves to quickly robotize standard and mechanical intellectual cycles. The utilization of smart calculations can robotize the method involved with gathering information from different CVs. Thusly, we can play out an investigation because of Man-made consciousness in HR divisions to decide the ability of a representative and their situation inside the organization. Obviously, ensure that the calculation functions admirably and has a low mistake rate. 

* Virtual assistance: Organizations use chatbots for an assortment of utilizations, for example, client care. In this sense, a computerized reasoning (simulated intelligence) administration can be utilized to address basic inquiries and permits human specialists to zero in on the most important issues. 

* Better customer service: For companies that sell products or services, knowing prices, stocks and the presence of the company's products as well as those of competitors is a great help and thanks to IA and data it is possible to know and find patterns or fundamental behaviors for the company, which means greater efficiency when it comes to selling products. 

* Greater control in the legal field: Thanks to artificial intelligence tools to distinguish encroachments or misrepresentation as fast as could be expected and record them through screen captures. It assists organizations with distinguishing unapproved affiliates, control depictions and pictures that don't follow the necessities. 

With the points mentioned above, we can realize how companies are making the most of artificial intelligence, thus achieving greater efficiency and productivity. 

## Automation and augmentation of work with machine learning algorithms.
As in the previous point, companies are the ones that take the greatest advantage of machine learning, in this case, it is also possible to obtain greater automation. Among the best examples of automation are banking processes. ML and AI along has diminished the hour of the loaning system, expanding consumer loyalty. From application, pre-screening, examination, assessment, endorsement, and the whole advance reimbursement process, which converts into lost time for both the bank and the client [3]. 

The ML can analyze a huge amount of credit transactions and thanks to its algorithms it can detect and predict fraud, saving time for the bank. This may seem like there will be less work for people, but there will actually be an increase in work for skilled people [4], as automation means an increase in income. 

Some of the areas where there will be more work thanks to ML are as follows: 

* Customer service. 

* Preventive actions. 

* Reduction of errors. 

* Cybersecurity. 

* Fraud detection. 

## The characteristics of big data and cloud computing.
It is the set of data so voluminous that regular information handling programming can't deal with it. Notwithstanding, these huge volumes of information can be utilized to address business issues that beforehand would not have been imaginable to tackle [5].

The main characteristics of big data are:
* Volume: This 'v' signifies handling enormous volumes of low-density unstructured data, which might be of obscure worth, for example, Twitter information channels, click streams on a website page or portable application, or hardware with sensors.

* Velocity: This "v" alludes to the rate at which data is gotten at which an activity can be applied to it. The most noteworthy pace of data is typically communicated straightforwardly to memory; however, some are in real time.

* Variety: This "v" alludes to the various kinds of data accessible. Normal data are social information that could be impeccably coordinated in relational data sets; however, with the big data, unstructured and semi-organized information, like text, sound or video, require extra pre-handling to comprehend their significance and backing metadata.

The main characteristics of cloud computing are:

* Self-service on request: When we have cloud services the IT group can arrangement assets at whatever point they are required, without the requirement for the supplier, permitting the office to react progressively to on-request increases and erasures.
* Extensive network access: The cloud makes administrations accessible over the network, liberating states from normalizing explicit gadgets and servers. Thusly, clients can get to administrations from any gadget, be it a cell phone, tablet, PC or work area.
* Cluster of resources: In the cloud, an abundance of apparently limited resources can be accessed, divided between various associations. This assists them with satisfying fluctuating needs on IT.
* Fast elasticity: The elasticity of the cloud offers you IT services that scale according to your needs, at a low cost.
* Measured service: In the cloud, their resource usage is measured, so we don't have to pay for computing power they don't need. Instead, we only pay for what they use.



## What is Blockchain?
Hyperledger is a technology that has been developed by the Linux Foundation in 2013, where they wanted to develop the use of blockchain among the different enterprises, this way they could take advantage of the technologies that are around the cryptocurrencies, and the development of that area to ensure that the commerce between enterprises is crawled. Because of this, there are many different enterprises that have been helping to develop this technology, enterprises such as IBM, Intel, Accenture, etc, provide support to Hyperledger. There are enterprises for all different industries. It should be able to create a network between technologies. There are some frameworks that let us integrate out block chain in our business logic. We can have tools that can allow us to make some intelligent contracts with most common tasks.

## Financial transactions

The financial transactions are being evolving through time, this is why it is needed to make some arrangements in the structure of the current financial technologies to make achievable this goal, because even if before pandemic this technology was growing rapidly, now a days with the health measurement, it is necessary to develop these technologies to avoid using cash as payment method, to avoid contact, enterprises promote new way to make transactions in order to make a real change in the different industries. The users and the enterprises are needed to be directly connected and the trust between them is the most important, this is why it is always going to be important to advance in the cybersecurity department, that can ensure the connection between the two or more subjects included in the process of the financial transactions.  

## Digital currencies

From Bitcoins to Dogecoins, the digital currencies have been getting a lot of popularity though time because of the success of the Bitcoins and all the technology that has been armored the digital currencies, despite there are many different digital currencies that may become confusing the process to understand what they are and where can they be employed there are many enterprises that have been relying in the cryptocurrencies, big companies like: Tesla, PayPal, and others that have been into the path of digital currencies.  

There are also some governments like the British that have been working in their own banks for acceptance the digital currencies, and that is a clear example of the transcendence of digital currencies, some years ago, in the definition we could have said that the digital currencies are not centralized, and that is not issued by neither a bank or government, now a days it is a way of payment that people take into consideration and that it has financial technology as core. There are also some challenges that will make feel digital currencies unstable, but at the end of the day they are technology based, and they deserve to have a chance in this globalized world. 

## Technical obstacles and political challenges (like bitcoin in El Salvador country)

To begging with this section, it is needed to understand that all the economy is based on the transactions between one person and another, so in case a government prohibits some practices like the use of digital currencies as a payment method, in case there is no opposition, all those currencies would not exist. Once we stat that point clear, it is needed to understand the context of a country, in our opinion, the bitcoin in El Salvador had two different approaches, one where it did make a great step when stating bitcoin as a payment method, but by making that, they didn’t think in the accessibility to the people that actually live there.  

In terms of technical obstacles, there are many of them, but the ones that we consider the most important are the high level of technical skills in order to achieve something new, and to really appreciate the most of the digital economy, and there are also some challenges that are very abstract and slows down the development of this technologies.  It should become a global goal to achieve in order to develop more features that can work under different situations.  

# Part 2 - Questions & Answers


## 1. Do you think artificial intelligence will always make us more efficient or productive, and why? (Jeorval)

## 8.- what are the "v's" about big data? (Jeorval)

Volume, velocity, variety, veracity viability, visualization, and value all of them related to data. 

## 9.- Why do you think blockchain is still not popular? (Jeorval)

Because people be afraid that it is not entirely secure and because of the lack of information or examples of use they may have, these factors were discussed in the talk we had about the blockchain and it was commented that more examples of use would help it to be used, for example that our university degrees would be transacted with blockchain. 


## 10.- Can blockchain be used for the transfer of a 50 m x 20 m plot of land and why?

Yes or course, because anything of value can be tracked and traded on a blockchain network. 

## 11.- If you wanted to create a planform with blockchain as engine, what should you use? 

The student should discuss how and why should use Hyperledger, and either if he would use it as a tool or as a framework 

## 12.- What are the challenges of financial transactions?

The use of technology to ensure the correct transactions between two entities, and the political challenges that could evolved because of the context of the individuals, country, and policies that are affecting the process.
